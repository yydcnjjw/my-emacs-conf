# Tasks: Preserve Comments in Writing Assist

- [x] 1. Implement `my/strip-markers` utility in `my-llm.el`.
- [x] 2. Update `my/select-sentence-at-point` to use marker stripping and return metadata.
- [x] 3. Update `my/render-improve-result` to use `search-forward` and `replace-match`.
- [x] 4. Verify the fix in Elisp buffers (both block and inline comments).
- [x] 5. Check if `my/translate-change-dwim` needs similar logic.
